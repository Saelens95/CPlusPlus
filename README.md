# myC++
Different programs that I conjured up for a past C++ course. 

There is no programSeven. It was fairly close to programSix with some minor updates. The jump from programSix to programEight is small.


Good luck, and please let me know if for any reason something (code) is faulty. I will fix ASAP.
